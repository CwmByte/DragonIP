Mask admin user IP addresses - both historical data and future activity

## Description

DragonIP protects administrator privacy by masking IP addresses throughout your WordPress installation. It can hide existing IP data and prevent future IP logging.

**What it does:**
* **Historical Masking** - Replace existing IP addresses with 127.0.0.1
* **Future Masking** - Automatically mask new IP addresses for ongoing activity
* **Smart Detection** - Works with comments, security plugins, and activity logs
* **Admin-Only** - Secure interface restricted to administrators

## Installation

1. Upload the `dragonip` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to **Tools > DragonIP** in your admin panel
